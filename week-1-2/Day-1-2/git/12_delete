Tom updates his local repository and finds the compiled binary in the src directory.
After viewing the commit message, he realizes that the compiled binary was added by Jerry.
    [tom@CentOS src]$ pwd
    /home/tom/project/src

    [tom@CentOS src]$ ls
    Makefile string_operations string_operations.c

    [tom@CentOS src]$ file string_operations
    string_operations: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses
    shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.18, not stripped

    [tom@CentOS src]$ git log
    commit 29af9d45947dc044e33d69b9141d8d2dad37cc62

    Added compiled binary

VCS is used to store the source code only and not executable binaries.
So, Tom decides to remove this file from the repository. For further operation, he uses the git rm command.

    [tom@CentOS src]$ ls
    Makefile string_operations string_operations.c

    [tom@CentOS src]$ git rm string_operations
    rm 'src/string_operations'

    [tom@CentOS src]$ git commit -a -m "Removed executable binary"

    [master 5776472] Removed executable binary
    1 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
    delete mode 100755 src/string_operations

After commit, he pushes his changes to the repository.

    [tom@CentOS src]$ git push origin master
