Till now, both Tom and Jerry were using manual commands to compile their project.
Now, Jerry decides to create Makefile for their project and also give a proper name to the file “string.c”.


    [jerry@CentOS project]$ pwd
    /home/jerry/jerry_repo/project

    [jerry@CentOS project]$ ls
    README src

    [jerry@CentOS project]$ cd src/

    [jerry@CentOS src]$ git add Makefile

    [jerry@CentOS src]$ git mv string.c string_operations.c

    [jerry@CentOS src]$ git status -s
    A Makefile
    R string.c −> string_operations.c

Git is showing R before file name to indicate that the file has been renamed.

For commit operation, Jerry used -a flag, that makes git commit automatically detect the modified files.

    [jerry@CentOS src]$ git commit -a -m 'Added Makefile and renamed strings.c to string_operations.c '

    [master 94f7b26] Added Makefile and renamed strings.c to string_operations.c
    1 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
    create mode 100644 src/Makefile
    rename src/{string.c => string_operations.c} (100%)

After commit, he pushes his changes to the repository.

    [jerry@CentOS src]$ git push origin master
