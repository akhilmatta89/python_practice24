In the git project when you want to update some file and on the same file if some one has made soem chnages
and you are not having the latest changes in the local and when you try to push the changes it will give you the error

so avoid this before we start working on any branch we need to pull the latest changes from the remote branch and then we can start working on it

To do that the command is
    git pull origin master
