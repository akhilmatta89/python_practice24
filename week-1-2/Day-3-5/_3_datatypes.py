#In python we have 3 types of data types
#1. Numeric
#2. Sequence
#3. Boolean

#Numeric data types are :- Numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value.
#1. int
#2. float
#3. complex

#Text Sequence data types are :- Text Sequence data type representing a string of Unicode characters.
#1. str

#Boolean data types are :- Boolean data type representing True or False.
#1. bool

#sequence data types are :- Sequence data type represent the group of individual values as a single entity.
#1. list
#2. tuple
#3. range


#Python has the following built-in data types, in these categories:
#1. Text Type:	str
#2. Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
#3. Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
#4. Mapping Type:	dict
#5. Set Types:	set, frozenset
#6. Boolean Type:	bool


#Now i ll explain each data type in detail with examples
#1. Numeric data types are :- Numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value.

#1. int :- Int data type represent the integer values. It can be any length such as 10, 2, 29, -20, -150 etc.
# Int data type can be represented in three forms, such as decimal, binary and hexadecimal.
#2. float :- Float data type represent the floating point values.
# It is specified by a decimal point. It can be either used in exponential form or normal form.
#3. complex :- Complex data type represent the complex numbers like 2+3j, 3+4j, -5+6j etc.
# In these numbers, the real part is separated by the imaginary part by using a + sign.
#2. Text Sequence data types are :- Text Sequence data type representing a string of Unicode characters.
